# React 19 useEffect Cleanup Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the useEffect hook's cleanup function in React 19.  The example shows a scenario where the cleanup function, intended to be executed when the component unmounts, is not reliably called. This could lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Problem Description

The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array (`[]`) is typically used for side effects that should only run once after the initial render.  However, if the component unmounts before the next render, the cleanup function might not always execute.  This is more noticeable in scenarios involving asynchronous operations or interactions with external libraries.

## Solution

The solution provided addresses the reliability of the cleanup function's execution.  It does not introduce any new side effects and ensures that the cleanup function is always called regardless of unmounting.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the console logs and component behavior to confirm the issue and solution.
